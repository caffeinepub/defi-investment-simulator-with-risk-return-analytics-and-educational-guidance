  "summary": "REQ-13 appears implemented via a new monochromatic OKLCH token palette plus global subtle focus glow styling and grayscale chart tokens. REQ-14 appears implemented by introducing compounding frequencies and wiring fee calculations to a compounding selection in the LP calculator. REQ-15 is only partially implemented: the UI flow and fallback/error handling are present, but the live-market-data adapter currently does not parse/return any live assets and will always fail.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "If live data fetch succeeds, the simulator uses the live market data values for assets/rates/parameters.",
      "reason": "The live data adapter builds an empty `assets` array and then explicitly throws an error when `assets.length === 0`, meaning live mode cannot succeed and therefore cannot drive the simulator with real fetched values.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Make the existing “Live Data (if available)” mode functional by implementing live market data loading for the existing Aave/Compound adapters.",
      "reason": "Although fetch + timeout + error messaging exist, the code comments indicate parsing is not implemented and the function is designed to fail when it cannot parse into `Asset[]`.",
